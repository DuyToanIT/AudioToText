A man and a woman are at a party. 
They are strangers. 
This is the first time they meet. 
The woman sees the man first. 
He is talking to some of his friends. 
“He has a nice smile”, she thinks.
In the eighteenth century, however, manliness was very different from what it is today. 
As well as wearing wigs, perfume and lots of make-up, a true gentleman showed his feelings by crying frequently in public.
But people have not always had the same ideas about beauty. 
Until the 1920s, suntanned people were considered as poor people. 
Women liked staying out of the sun to keep them as pale as possible
